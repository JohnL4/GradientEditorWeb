* GradientEditorWeb

  Gradient editor using web technologies.

  Originally intended to be useful with this planet-making software:
  http://www.diku.dk/~torbenm/Planet/, but the software as written doesn't normalize high altitudes
  (in the case when you set initial values to be elevated so that the planet will be a desert
  planet), it just clips them at max. value, with the result that you get large areas colored with
  one color, no matter gradient you supply.

  Oh, well, still, looks like a good algorithm, so maybe I can re-implement and then use this
  gradient editor.

  Still a worthy exercise in itself.

* Table Hijinks

  We want something like this:

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE

  +-----+------+-------+-----+
  | Add | Posn | Color | Del |
  +-----+------+-------+-----+
  |     |  xx  |   xx  | Del |
  +-----+      |       |     |
  | Add +------+-------+-----|
  +-----+  yy  |  yy   | Del |
  | Add +------+-------+-----|
  +-----+  zz  |  zz   | Del |
  | Add +------+-------+-----|
  +-----+                    |

  #+END_EXAMPLE

  This ain't gonna work, btw.  Well, maybe it could, but I'm getting lost in the rowspans.
